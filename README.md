Now you need to refill it

Each ender pearl will give you 10 seconds of flight time.

Note: If you add ender pearls to the crafting grid one by one the description of the EnderFly will not update
but once you craft it you will still recive the maximum amount of flight time possible

After your refill, equip the chestplate and activate it by middle clicking the chest. Now it should look something like this:

To deactivate it, simply click the chest again or land. Once the time runs out the EnderFly will also deactivate

Note: Sprinting is 3x as expensive as normal Flight
